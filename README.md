# SpacePong
Space Pong is a typical pong game made using Unity3D and C# for study purpose 


I’m glad to introduce you my first game made with Unity3D engine, so far it just the basic pong game, with very primitive AI, score system, main menu and 7 rounds gameplay after which will popup a windows that says which player won. All the sprites and background images are not mine, you are able to find links to originals in the References.txt file. Feel free to leave you feedback, suggestions, make changes or use my code in your projects.

Future plans: 
- Multiplayer mode, this will allow to turn off the AI and instead let two people play on one keyboard, Player1 will use [W] [S] keys to move while Player2 will be able to use [Up] [Down].  |Done|
- More complicated AI and Random events. Random events that will increase or decrease AI’s speed, for balance purpose, also randomly changed Ball’s speed.
- Add animations while objects under influence of events that has been described above. 
- Animation on collusions 
- Sound effects. Background music, sound on collusion, sounds when player wins/loses. 
- Add difficulty levels
